This document consists in a tutorial to the Stata script for creating a stacked data matrix (SDM) of the European Election Study ( [EES](http://europeanelectionstudies.net/) ) Italian voter study of 2019. The first part of the script is dedicated to



# Data {-}

Data can be downloaded through the following link: [https://github.com/giucarny/StackMat/archive/refs/heads/master.zip](https://github.com/giucarny/StackMat/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). After clicking or browsing the link, a `.zip` folder named 'StackMat-master' will be automatically downloaded. Unzip it and browse it at your wish.   
Briefly, this folder represents the copy of a public GitHub repository named 'StackMat' that contains three main subdirectories:  

- '**Data**': In which are stored the (main and auxiliary) datasets for the stacking procedure (e.g., the dataset of the EES voter study of 2019) as well as the SDM genered by the Stata script (`EES2019_it_stacked_stata.csv`);  
- '**Scripts**': In which are stored the (main and auxiliary) scripts for stacking a conventional matrix, including the Stata script presented in this tutorial;  
- '**Documentation**': A folder containing relevant documents for the stacking process (e.g., the EES 2019 voter study questionnaire and codebook) and the tutorial (e.g., the codebook of the SDM generated by the Stata script presented below).
