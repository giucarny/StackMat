# Overview {-}

This document consists in the codebook of the stacked European Election Studies (EES) Italian voter study of 2019 as created by the scripts provided for the workshop. The logic and structure of the codebook resembles those of the True European Voter (TEV) codebook. The variables available in the dataset are grouped as it follows: 

* Identification Variables 
* Voting Behaviour and Background Variables
* Voter-Party Positional Variables
* Generic and Synthetic Variables


# Identification Variables {-}

## respid {-}
Unique identifier of individual respondents as it was assigned in the EES 2019 Italian voter study (`respid`; See the [EES2019 Codebook](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67448)).

## party {-}
Unique identifier of the Italian parties participating to the European Parliament (EP) elections of 2019. Values equate to those defined in the original EES 2019 vote choice variable referring to the 2019 EP elections (`Q7`; See the [EES2019 Codebook](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67448)). Only parties for which propensity to vote (PTV) variables where available in the EES 2019 Italian voter study have been selected. 

Values: 

1501 - Democratic Party (*Partito Democratico*)  
1502 - Go Italy (*Forza Italia*)  
1503 - Northern League (*Lega - Salvini Premier*)  
1504 - Five Star Movement (*Movimento 5 Stelle*)  
1505 - Italian Left (*Sinistra Italiana*)  
1506 - More Europe (*+Europa*)  
1507 - Brothers of Italy (*Fratelli d'Italia*)  

99 - Missing

## stackid {-}
Unique identifier of party-voter dyadic relationships. It represents the combination of EES 2019 Italian voter study (1) respondents' identification numbers (`respid`) and (2) party unique identifier variable (`party`). 

Example: The dyad referring to the relationship between the respondent identified by the number 778 and the Italian Democratic Party (*Partito Democratico*; code 1501) would be '778-1501'.

Values: 

1501 - Democratic Party (*Partito Democratico*)

1506 - More Europe (*+Europa*)  
1507 - Brothers of Italy (*Fratelli d'Italia*)

## pid {-}

Example:
In the EES 2019 voter study, the party code of the 2019 EP elections vote choice variable (`Q7`; See the [EES2019 Codebook](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67448)) that refers to the Italian Democratic Party (*Partito Democratico*) is `1501`. However, in the party identification variable of the EES 2019 voter study  (`Q25`; See the [EES2019 Codebook](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67448)) the Italian Democratic Party is coded `1502`. Consequently, the choice has been to recode the latter in accordance with the former.
